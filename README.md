# Mine-Sweeper
Created the classic Mine Sweeper game using Python. The goal of the game is to find all the mines present and mark them in the shortest time possible.
Each tile either contains a mine(bomb) or a number indicating the total number of neighbouring bombs(can be empty as well, based on proximity of bomb).
Incase you click a mine, you lose. If all the tiles without mines are opened successfully, you win.
Features: 
1. The first tile is never a mine.
2. The bomb symbols can be used to mark the mines by the player.
3. The question mark symbol can be used incase the player is not sure if a tile has mine and wants to keep it aside for a while.
